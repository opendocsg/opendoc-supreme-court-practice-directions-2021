## 107. Draft orders 

107.	Draft orders

(1)	Order 17, Rule 3(5) and (6) of the Rules of Court 2021 place the burden of approving the drafts of judgments and orders on the solicitors themselves. The solicitors should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval.

(2)	The Registrar’s signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order.

(3)	Subject to sub-paragraph (4), parties in applications with notice should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment or order for signature by the Registrar after agreeing on the draft. Draft orders for applications without notice may be submitted with the application without notice and the supporting affidavit when these are filed.

(4)	For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders is as follows:

<ul type="*">
(a)	Parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of court through the Electronic Filing Service.

(b)	Before filing the system-generated order of court, the party extracting the order must:

<ul type="*">
<li>(i)	review and edit the order of court electronic form to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court; and</li>

<li>(ii)	obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of court, for example, a Portable Document Format (PDF) copy of the draft order of court signed by the solicitors of all parties to the application.</li>
</ul>

(c)	The Registry will seal and issue an engrossed order of court once its terms are approved.
</ul>

(5)	Order 17, Rule 3(7) and (8) of the Rules of Court 2021 will apply where there is a dispute on the terms of the draft order:

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	In such a case, the party who drew up the order may write to the Court to resolve the dispute and the letter must set out the areas of dispute.</li>

<li>(b)	The party is responsible for including in the letter all versions of the terms of the draft in dispute between the parties and all relevant correspondence.</li>

<li>(c)	The Court may give its decision on the dispute on the terms of the draft without the attendance of the parties or fix an appointment to hear the parties on the dispute.</li>
</ul>

(6)	Where any of the other parties has no solicitor, the draft order is to be submitted to the Registrar.

## 108. Judgment in default 

(1)	The procedure for applying for judgment to be given where, within the prescribed period, (a) no notice of intention to contest or not contest is filed and served, (b) a notice stating that the defendant does not intend to contest is filed and served, (c) no defence or defence to counterclaim is filed and served, is by filing an application in Forms 11 or 14 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions, as the case may be.

(2)	A party filing an application for judgment in default in Form 11 or 14 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions must also file a memorandum of service in Form 12 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions, a draft of the judgment which the party seeks to apply for, a note of costs, and, where the judgment is for possession of immovable property, a certificate by the party’s solicitor (or where the party is not legally represented, an affidavit) stating that no relief is sought in the nature of reliefs under Order 52, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court 2021.

(3)	In order to satisfy itself that judgment should be given under Order 6, Rule 6(5) or 7(7) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Court may require an affidavit to be filed stating the time, place and method of service of the originating claim on the defendant, as well as the fact that the defendant had, within the prescribed period, failed to file and serve a notice of intention to contest or not contest, or a defence, as the case may be.
 
(4)	Sub-paragraph (3) applies, with the necessary modifications, to a judgment in default under Order 6, Rule 9(3) of the Rules of Court 2021.
