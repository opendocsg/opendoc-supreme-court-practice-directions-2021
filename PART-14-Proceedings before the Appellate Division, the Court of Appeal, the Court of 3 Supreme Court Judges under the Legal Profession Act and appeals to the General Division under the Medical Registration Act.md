(For example, if the sitting period starts on Monday, 18 February 2019 and ends on Friday, 8 March 2019, all skeletal arguments for matters listed before the Court of Appeal in that sitting period must be filed by 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 January 2019.)</li>

	<li>(b) the draft charge(s) the prosecution will be proceeding with, where applicable; and</li>
	<li>(c) any other supporting documents, including any exhibits referred to in the conditioned statements of all witnesses.</li>
