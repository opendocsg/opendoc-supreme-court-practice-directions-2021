(2)	There is to be one or more Divisional Registrars for the Court of Appeal and the Appellate Division, for the General Division, and for the Singapore International Commercial Court.

(3)	The Chief Justice may designate any Assistant Registrar as Senior Assistant Registrar. The Chief Justice may also designate the Deputy Registrar, any Senior Assistant Registrar or any Assistant Registrar as Divisional Registrar or Deputy Divisional Registrar of any division of the Registry.

(4)	Appendix C of these Practice Directions sets out the names of the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars, Divisional Registrars and Deputy Divisional Registrars.

(5)	To avoid doubt, it is hereby declared that any instruction manuals which may be issued from time to time by the Government are not applicable to the business of the Registry.

Where a hearing is conducted by means of video conferencing or telephone conferencing using a remote communication technology approved by the Chief Justice or authorised by the Court, and the Court has authorised the making of a recording of the hearing using such remote communication technology, the recording so made will, unless the Court otherwise directs, constitute the Court’s notes of proceedings for the purposes of Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021.

(2)	Without limiting Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Court may determine, for the purposes of that provision, that the Court’s notes of proceedings are to be taken down by a person other than the Court, whether by hand or through the use of any computer or electronic device.

(3)	The provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are subject to any directions made by the Court hearing the matter, or by the Registrar, whether or not upon application by the parties. Such directions may include the use of alternative means of producing transcripts.

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	the transcript of the notes of proceedings will constitute the Court’s note of proceedings for the purposes of Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021; and</li>

<li>(b)	the parties must inform the Registry by letter at least 7 working days before the scheduled hearing as to the mode by which the proceedings will be recorded.</li>

## 16. Interpreters and translation

(1)	The directions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (8) below are to be followed in relation to all requests for interpretation services of interpreters from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section, whether the services are required for hearings in open court or in chambers.

(2)	Not less than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are required (“scheduled day”), the requesting party must file a Request electronic form addressed to the appropriate Head Interpreter through the Electronic Filing Service in the manner and form set out in Form B1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

(3)	The Request in sub-paragraph (2) must be filed for hearings of matters which have been adjourned or part-heard, even if the services of an interpreter were requested and provided at an earlier hearing of the same matter. In the event that a Request is made in respect of an adjourned or part-heard matter, the Request should state the date of the earlier hearing.

(4)	The requesting party must make payment of any prescribed fees for interpretation services under the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 upon approval of the Request.

(5)	In the event that the services of the interpreter are for any reason not required on any of the scheduled days specified in the Request, the requesting party must immediately notify the appropriate Head Interpreter either by letter or email. This will serve as a notice of cancellation.

(6)	Any request for refund of the fee paid under sub-paragraph (4) must be submitted to the Registrar through the Electronic Filing Service within 1 month after the date on which the reason for the refund arose. The supporting reasons and the amount of refund sought must be clearly indicated in the request for refund.

(7)	Unless otherwise decided by the Registrar, the fee paid for any scheduled day may be refunded only if a notice of cancellation under sub-paragraph (5) is given at least 1 clear working day prior to that scheduled day.

(8)	The provision of interpretation services by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is subject to the availability of suitable interpreters on the day that the interpretation services are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) may result in the services of interpreters not being available or provided.

(9)	Engagement of private interpreters (i.e., interpreters not from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section):

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	To avoid doubt, a party may engage the services of a private interpreter for interpretation services in respect of the languages listed in Form B1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.</li>

<li>(b)	If a party requires the services of an interpreter in a language apart from those listed in Form B1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions, it is the duty of the party to engage such an interpreter directly to obtain his or her services for the scheduled hearing.</li>

<li>(c)	Interpreters who are not from the Supreme Court's Interpreters Section must be sworn in before the Duty Registrar before they may provide interpretation services for proceedings in Court.</li>

</ul>

(10)	Requests for translation of documents in Chinese, Malay or Tamil for use in Supreme Court proceedings must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service at least 4 weeks before the date the translations are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in this sub- paragraph may result in translations not being available or provided by the date they are required.

(11)	In the event that the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is unable to accept a translation request, parties and counsel should approach a private translation service instead.

(12)	A party who is not legally represented may submit his or her request for interpretation services or translation of documents for Supreme Court proceedings using the respective forms available on the Singapore Courts website at [https://www.judiciary.gov.sg](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg).

## 17. Access to case file, inspection, taking copies and searches

***Access by parties to a case file***

(1)	All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the electronic case file made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the electronic case file.

(2)	Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure in sub-paragraph (5) below must be followed.

(3)	All parties to a case have the liberty to make amendments to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he or she may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file.

(4)	The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof.

***File inspection by non-parties or parties who are not registered users***

(5)	In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed:

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	A Request should be made to obtain permission to inspect the file. The Request should state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a solicitor, his or her identification and contact details should also be included in the Request, and his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) should be produced for verification when requested. The Request should also state the interest that the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the Request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter.</li>

<li>(b)	Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court,</li>

<ul type="*">

<li>(i)	registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; and</li>

<li>(ii)	parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval, the service bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

(6)	Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their employees who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period.

(7)	All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors are responsible for informing their clients of this. To avoid doubt, a non-party that has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection.

***Obtaining certified true copies of documents***

(8)	Users are encouraged to use the Authentic Court Order system to validate orders of court issued after 2 January 2020 by going to [https://www.courtorders.gov.sg](https://www.courtorders.gov.sg). However, certified true copies of orders of court will still be available upon application.

(9)	Applications to obtain certified true copies of documents should be made by way of filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service.

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described.</li>

<li>(b)	The applicant will be informed of the outcome to his or her Request and the fees payable for the provision of the certified true copies if the Request is approved. Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, the certified true copies will be released to the applicant. The Registry may require verification of the identity of the applicant against his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) prior to the release of the certified true copies.</li>

<li>(c)	The fees prescribed by the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 will be payable for the provision of the above service.</li>

</ul>

***Electronic cause books and registers maintained by the Registry***

(10)	For the purposes of Order 26, Rule 3(1) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Registry must maintain the following Court records:

(12)	An application may be made by any person for a licence to use any information contained in any electronic cause book or register subject to such terms and conditions as the Registrar may determine.

If the letter relates to an interlocutory application, the reference number of that application <strong>should be stated in the caption below the parties’ names. For example:</strong>

<ul type="*">

<li><strong><em>SUMMONS NO. 1 OF 2021</em></strong></li>

</ul>

(5)	Compliance with the directions in this paragraph will facilitate the expeditious processing of the request.

(6)	A letter may be sent to the Court by a law firm using the Electronic Filing Service only. If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm in any other way, it is liable to be rejected. If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm without the information specified in sub-paragraph (4), it is also liable to be rejected.

(7)	Sub-paragraph (6) does not apply to a party who is not legally represented.

(8)	Registrar’s Directions and Notices from the Registry will be sent to law firms who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service through the Electronic Filing Service. Registered users are to ensure that the inbox of their Electronic Filing Service account(s) are checked and cleared regularly.

## 22. Requesting a hearing date through the Electronic Filing Service

(1)	When filing applications through the Electronic Filing Service, solicitors may be permitted to make a request for a preferred hearing date for the following classes of applications:

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	interlocutory applications to be heard before Registrars;</li>

<li>(b)	bankruptcy applications; and</li>

<li>(c)	winding up applications.</li>

</ul>

(2)	Solicitors should confer with all parties to the application before selecting a preferred hearing date. Counsel arguing the application for all parties should be available to attend the hearing on the date selected.

(3)	In the event that it is not possible to confer with opposing counsel on a preferred hearing date, whether due to the nature or urgency of the application or otherwise, solicitors must select a date where counsel arguing the application for the applicant will be available.

## 23. Fixing of hearing dates

(1)	To assist the Registrar in the fixing of hearing dates, solicitors should provide updated information as to the current status of the cause or matter, including the prospects of settlement and any other developments which are likely to affect the length of the trial. In order to facilitate a more realistic assessment of the time required for the hearing, they will also be required to inform the Registrar of the number of witnesses they intend to call, whether any witness will require interpretation services, the estimated amount of time required for each party to cross- examine all the opposing party’s witnesses and the estimated total length of hearing.

(2)	Solicitors who attend before the Registrar for the fixing of hearing dates should be fully acquainted with the cause or matter being fixed for hearing. They should preferably be the solicitor having conduct of the cause or matter.

(3)	It is the duty of all parties to an action to furnish without delay to the Registrar all available information as to the likelihood of the action being settled, or affecting the estimated length of the trial, and, if the action is settled or withdrawn, to notify the Registrar of the fact without delay.

(4)	Further, parties are to note that any request for an early hearing date for any application, cause or matter is subject to the discretion and availability of the Court. In deciding when to fix an application, cause or matter for hearing or render its decision in any application, cause or matter, the Court is not obliged to give effect to any private agreement between parties on timelines and hearing dates.

## 24. Adjournment or vacation of trial dates and part-heard cases

(1)	Where dates have been fixed for the trial of any cause or matter, any request for an adjournment or vacation of the trial dates must be made to the Court by way of summons with a supporting affidavit, even in those cases where there is consent to the adjournment or vacation of the trial dates.

(2)	Subject to any directions of the Court, when a case is adjourned, the Registrar will assign such days as are available for the hearing of the case, and counsel will be expected to take the dates at short notice.

(3)	In the event that the hearing of a case is not concluded within the number of days allotted, the Court may direct the hearing of the case to continue beyond the allotted time, rather than adjourning the case part-heard to another date. Counsel for parties in all cases should therefore be prepared to continue with the hearing of the matter despite the fact that the time originally allotted may have expired.

## 25. Adjournment or vacation of hearings other than trials

(1)	Before any party makes a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to the Court for an adjournment or vacation of any hearings other than trials, he or she should seek the consent of the other party or parties to the matter. Unilateral requests made without first seeking the consent or views of the other party or parties to the matter will not be entertained, except in the most exceptional circumstances.

(2)	Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, the Request electronic form should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service at least 2 working days before the hearing, setting out the reasons for the requested adjournment or vacation of the hearing.

(3)	Where an adjournment of any matter before the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division is sought, the Request electronic form should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service as soon as practicable after the sitting in which the matter is scheduled to be heard has been assigned and notified to the parties. Where there is a delay in the making of the Request, the reason or reasons for the delay must be provided with the Request. Any request for an adjournment solely on account of counsel’s unavailability will not be acceded to readily.

(4)	If the consent of all other parties to the matter is obtained, a letter stating that all parties have consented to the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings may be attached to the Request electronic form. However, this does not mean that the Request will be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still evaluate the merits of the Request before making its decision.

(5)	If the consent of one or more of the other parties is not obtained, the letter should set out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the parties should also be attached to the Request electronic form. The Court will then evaluate the contents of the Request and the relevant correspondence before deciding whether the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings should be allowed.

(6)	In any other case, parties must attend before the Court to make an application for an adjournment. See also paragraph 88 of these Practice Directions.

## 26. Authorisation for collection of Court documents or mail

(1)	Without limiting sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), all law firms are required to notify the Registry of the particulars of person(s) authorised to collect Court documents or mail from the Supreme Court on their behalf by submitting a request to authorise user through the Electronic Filing Service.

(2)	Where such authorised persons are no longer so authorised, law firms are required to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Until receipt of such notification of revocation or deletion, Court documents and mail will continue to be released to such authorised persons upon production of evidence of identification.

(3)	Any solicitor may collect Court documents or mail on behalf of his or her firm and any person who is not legally represented may collect Court documents or mail intended for him or her in any matter in which he or she is a party.

(4)	A law firm may authorise a courier service provider to collect Court documents or mail from the Supreme Court on their behalf. At the time of collection, the courier service provider should produce a letter of authorisation which is printed on the law firm’s letterhead and addressed to the courier service provider. The said letter of authorisation should clearly state the case number, the name of the courier service provider appointed to collect and the Court documents or mail to be collected. An employee or representative of the courier service provider collecting the Court documents or mail may be requested to provide evidence that will allow the Registry to verify that he or she is an employee or representative from the courier service provider, and will have to acknowledge receipt of the Court documents or mail collected.

## 27. Electronic payment of Court fees

***Implementation of electronic means for payment of Court fees***

(1)	Subject to these Practice Directions, all Court fees not paid using the Electronic Filing Service must be paid by electronic means.

***Modes of payment by electronic means***

(2)	Payment by electronic means includes payment effected by Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS and selected credit cards. For law firms with standing GIRO arrangements with the Supreme Court, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment where Court fees are paid over the counter. A law firm using IBG for such purposes will authorise the Supreme Court to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed form.

***Scope of payment by electronic means***

(3)	The electronic means of payment cover all Court fees previously collected over the counter and hearing fees in the Supreme Court.

***Registrar’s discretion***

(4)	Unless otherwise approved by the Registrar, payment of Court fees collected over the counter must be made by electronic means. The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirement for the payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as the Registrar deems fit.

## 28. Use of the Video Conference Facilities and the Mobile Infocomm Technology Facilities

(1)	The video conference facilities and the Mobile Infocomm Technology Facilities (“MIT facilities”) may, at the discretion of the Registrar, be used:
<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	for the hearing of any matter, whether before a Judge or Registrar, in open court or in chambers; or</li>

<li>(b)	for any other dispute resolution process.</li>
</ul>
(2)	The Registrar may refuse any request for the use of any of the services described in this Part at any time owing to the unavailability of staff or equipment or for any other reason. The Registrar need not give any reasons for the refusal of such a request.

## 29. Applications to use the Video Conference Facilities and Usage of Additional Equipment

</ul>

(4)	Any person who desires to use audio-visual and computer equipment additional to those provided in a courtroom will be asked to provide details of such equipment.
