(1)	Pursuant to section 71(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and Order 26, Rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Chief Justice has directed that the Registry of the Supreme Court (“the Registry”) comprises the Division for the Court of Appeal and the Appellate Division, the Division for the General Division and the Division for the Singapore International Commercial Court

(2)	There is to be a Divisional Registrar for the Court of Appeal and the Appellate Division, a Divisional Registrar for the General Division, and a Divisional Registrar for the Singapore International Commercial Court. The Divisional Registrar for each division of the Registry will have control and supervision of the affairs of that division. Overall control and supervision of the Registry will remain with the Registrar of the Supreme Court.

(3)	The Chief Justice may designate any Assistant Registrar as Senior Assistant Registrar. The Chief Justice may also designate the Deputy Registrar, any Senior Assistant Registrar or any Assistant Registrar as Divisional Registrar or Deputy Divisional Registrar of any division of the Registry.

(4)	Appendix C of these Practice Directions sets out the names of the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Divisional and Deputy Divisional Registrars, and Senior Assistant Registrars.

(5)	To avoid doubt, it is hereby declared that any instruction manuals which may be issued from time to time by the Government are not applicable to the business of the Registry.

## 11. Operating hours of the Supreme Court

(1)	The Supreme Court operates from 8.30 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. from Monday to Friday. However, various offices and counters within the Supreme Court have different operating hours.

(4)	Where hearings are conducted by video conferencing or telephone conferencing, all Court rules and practices on dress and etiquette will continue to apply. However, it will not be necessary to stand and/or bow to the Court at the start or end of the hearing or to stand when addressing the Court.

## 14. Production of record of hearing

(1)	An audio recording mentioned in Order 15, Rule 11(6) of the Rules of Court 2021 will be made by the Court in every open court trial in an action begun by originating claim. Where a hearing is conducted by means of video conferencing or telephone conferencing using a remote communication technology approved by the Chief Justice or authorised by the Court, and the Court has authorised the making of a recording of the hearing using such remote communication technology, the recording so made will, unless the Court otherwise directs, constitute the Court’s notes of proceedings for the purposes of Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021.

(2)	Without limiting Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Court may determine, for the purposes of that provision, that the Court’s notes of proceedings are to be taken down by a person other than the Court, whether by hand or through the use of any computer or electronic device.

(3)	The provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are subject to any directions made by the Court hearing the matter, or by the Registrar, whether or not upon application by the parties. Such directions may include the use of alternative means of producing transcripts.

(4)	Where the Court makes directions under sub-paragraph (3) for the use of alternative means of producing transcripts:

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	the transcript of the notes of proceedings will constitute the Court’s note of proceedings for the purposes of Order 15, Rule 11(7) of the Rules of Court 2021; and</li>

<li>(b)	the parties must inform the Registry by letter at least 7 working days before the scheduled hearing as to the mode by which the proceedings will be recorded.</li>
</ul>

(5)	The costs of engaging a service provider must be paid by the parties directly to the service provider.

<li>(a)	the Judge or judicial officer having conduct of the proceedings;</li>

<li>(b)	with the approval of the Court, the Manager or Personal Assistant, as the case may be, to the Judge or judicial officer having conduct of the proceedings; or</li>

</ul>

(2)	The costs of producing a certified transcript of the official record of the hearing may be claimed as an item of disbursement unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

## 16. Interpreters and translation

(1)	The directions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (8) below are to be followed in relation to all requests for interpretation services of interpreters from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section, whether the services are required for hearings in open court or in chambers.

(2)	Not less than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are required (“scheduled day”), the requesting party must file a Request electronic form addressed to the appropriate Head Interpreter through the Electronic Filing Service in the manner and form set out in Form 1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

(3)	The Request in sub-paragraph (2) must be filed for hearings of matters which have been adjourned or part-heard, even if the services of an interpreter were requested and provided at an earlier hearing of the same matter. In the event that a Request is made in respect of an adjourned or part-heard matter, the Request should state the date of the earlier hearing.

(4)	The requesting party must make payment of any prescribed fees for interpretation services under the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 upon approval of the Request.

(5)	In the event that the services of the interpreter are for any reason not required on any of the scheduled days specified in the Request, the requesting party must immediately notify the appropriate Head Interpreter either by letter or email. This will serve as a notice of cancellation.

(6)	Any request for refund of the fee paid under sub-paragraph (4) must be submitted to the Registrar through the Electronic Filing Service within 1 month after the date on which the reason for the refund arose. The supporting reasons and the amount of refund sought must be clearly indicated in the request for refund.

(7)	Unless otherwise decided by the Registrar, the fee paid for any scheduled day may be refunded only if a notice of cancellation under sub-paragraph (5) is given at least 1 clear working day prior to that scheduled day.

(8)	The provision of interpretation services by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is subject to the availability of suitable interpreters on the day that the interpretation services are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) may result in the services of interpreters not being available or provided.

(9)	Engagement of private interpreters (i.e., interpreters not from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section):

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	To avoid doubt, a party may engage the services of a private interpreter for interpretation services in respect of the languages listed in Form 1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.</li>

<li>(b)	If a party requires the services of an interpreter in a language apart from those listed in Form 1 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions, it is the duty of the party to engage such an interpreter directly to obtain his or her services for the scheduled hearing.</li>

<li>(c)	Interpreters who are not from the Supreme Court's Interpreters Section must be sworn in before the Duty Registrar before they may provide interpretation services for proceedings in Court.</li>
</ul>

(10)	Requests for translation of documents in Chinese, Malay or Tamil for use in Supreme Court proceedings must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service at least 4 weeks before the date the translations are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in this sub- paragraph may result in translations not being available or provided by the date they are required.

(11)	In the event that the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is unable to accept a translation request, parties and counsel should approach a private translation service instead.

(12)	A party who is not legally represented may submit his or her request for interpretation services or translation of documents for Supreme Court proceedings using the respective forms available on the Singapore Courts website at [http://www.judiciary.gov.sg](http://www.judiciary.gov.sg).

## 17. Access to case file, inspection, taking copies and searches 

***Access by parties to a case file***

(1)	All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the electronic case file made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the electronic case file.

(2)	Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure in sub-paragraph (5) below must be followed.

(3)	All parties to a case have the liberty to make amendments to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he or she may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file.

(4)	The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof.

***File inspection by non-parties or parties who are not registered users***

(5)	In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed:

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	A Request should be made to obtain permission to inspect the file. The Request should state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a solicitor, his or her identification and contact details should also be included in the Request, and his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) should be produced for verification when requested. The Request should also state the interest that the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the Request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter.</li>

<li>(b)	Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court,</li>
<ul type="*">
<li>(i)	registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; and</li>

<li>(ii)	parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval, the service bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

(6)	Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their employees who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period.
 
(7)	All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors are responsible for informing their clients of this. To avoid doubt, a non-party that has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection.

***Obtaining certified true copies of documents***

(8)	Users are encouraged to use the Authentic Court Order system to validate orders of court issued after 2 January 2020 by going to [http://www.courtorders.gov.sg](http://www.courtorders.gov.sg). However, certified true copies of orders of court will still be available upon application.

(9)	Applications to obtain certified true copies of documents should be made by way of filing a Request through the Electronic Filing Service.

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the Request. The relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described.</li>

<li>(b)	The applicant will be informed of the outcome to his or her Request and the fees payable for the provision of the certified true copies if the Request is approved. Upon confirmation of the receipt of payment of the fees payable, the certified true copies will be released to the applicant. The Registry may require verification of the identity of the applicant against his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) prior to the release of the certified true copies.</li>

<li>(c)	The fees prescribed by the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 will be payable for the provision of the above service.</li>
</ul>

***Electronic cause books and registers maintained by the Registry***

(10)	For the purposes of Order 26, Rule 3(1) of the Rules of Court 2021, the Registry must maintain the following Court records:

(11)	Searches for any Court records mentioned in sub-paragraph (10) may be conducted through the Electronic Filing Service at a service bureau or at the Registry. The fees prescribed by the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 will be payable for such searches.

(12)	An application may be made by any person for a licence to use any information contained in any electronic cause book or register subject to such terms and conditions as the Registrar may determine. Successful applicants will be required to enter into separate technical services agreements with the Electronic Filing Service provider.

(2)	The directions set out in sub-paragraph (1) will also apply to a party who wishes to file a document which alters the powers created in a document that is filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the Registry on or after 28 May 2002. If the document relates to a document that is presented for deposit before 28 May 2002, the document must be filed manually in hard copy.

(3)	The Registry will not accept a document named as a deed of revocation if the deed only seeks to partially revoke the powers created in a document.

(1)	All Requests relating to or in connection with any pending cause or matter are to be made using the electronic forms available through the Electronic Filing Service. Where an electronic form is available through the Electronic Filing Service for the Request that is sought, the Registry has the discretion to refuse acceptance of other forms of written correspondence (including letters) and to refuse to act on such correspondence.

(2)	All correspondence to the Court relating to or in connection with any pending cause or matter must be copied to all other parties to the cause or matter or to their solicitors unless there are good reasons for not doing so. Solicitors are further reminded that the Court should not be copied on correspondence between parties or their solicitors. The Registry has the discretion to reject or refuse to act on any inappropriate correspondence or correspondence that is not copied to all other parties to the cause or matter or to their solicitors unless there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4)	In addition, all letters should be captioned with the number of the case to which they relate and the names of the parties. For example:
```
SUIT NO. 1 OF 2021 (if an action begun by originating claim);


Between AB (and ANOR or ORS, if there are 2 or more claimants, as the case may be) and CD (and ANOR or ORS, if there are 2 or more defendants, as the case may be)
```
If the letter relates to an interlocutory application, the reference number of that application should be stated in the caption below the parties’ names. For example:
```
SUMMONS NO. 1 OF 2021
```

(5)	Compliance with the directions in this paragraph will facilitate the expeditious processing of the request.

(6)	A letter may be sent to the Court by a law firm using the Electronic Filing Service only. If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm in any other way, it is liable to be rejected.
